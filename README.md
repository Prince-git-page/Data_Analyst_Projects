# Predicting Restaurant Tips Using Predictive Analytics on Excel
To predict restaurant tips given input values with the mathematical equation for predicting the value of the tip

## Dataset Used
 [Dataset](https://github.com/Prince-git-page/Data_Analyst_Projects/blob/main/1715854881_restaurant_tips_dataset.xlsx)

# KPIs
 Perform the below tasks on the dataset provided using Excel:
 1. Use the restaurant tips file for the analytics using Excel
 2. Find out if there are any missing values and clean the data
 • Remove rows with at least one empty cell; choose all data using 
Control+A and in the home tab, click on Find & Select and go to 
Special.
 Data tab, click on Remove duplicates
 • Check for duplicates: Choose the dataset using Control+A; In the 
3. Find the features that are independent and dependent
 4. Identify which predictive problem is needed
 5. Encode the categorical variables to numeric values using IF conditions
 • For each independent numeric value, find its correlation 
coefficient with respect to the tip. The correlation coefficient is 
derived from the formula CORREL(array1, array2) where array1 is 
all the independent variables and array2 is the tip variable.
 6. Build an appropriate model with the dataset
 7. Calculate the predicted and actual tips values
 8. Calculate the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of the model. RMSE is the 
root of the mean of square errors
